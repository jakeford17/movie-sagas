# Movie Sagas
For this project, I built a movie application that allows a user to see movies that exist in the database. The user can also see a detailed view for each individual movie, including genres associated with that movie. From that view, one can edit the movie's information.

## Installation
* `npm install`
* In separate Terminal tabs `npm run client` and `npm run server`

## Technologies Used
Movie Sagas used the following technologies: React, React-Redux, Redux-Sagas, Node.js, Express.js, Passport, PostgreSQL, and CSS for styling.

## Acknowledgement
I'd like to thank Prime Digital Academy and my classmates in the Porta cohort for their help and support with this project.
